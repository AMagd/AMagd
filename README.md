# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Egyptian Computer Scientist and Researcher currently working as a research intern at Johns Hopkins University CCVL Lab ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬. My work primarily focuses on generative models and reinforcement learning for medical images.

Previously, I was a researcher at KAIST's School of Computing in the Machine Learning and Mind Lab led by Professor Sungjin Ahn ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·. During my time there, I worked extensively on reinforcement learning and generative models. I hold an MS in Robotics from KAIST, where I researched machine learning and computer vision for self-driving cars under Professor Dongsuk Kum.

I am passionate about solving challenging problems in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the fields of:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Generative Models
- Computer Vision
